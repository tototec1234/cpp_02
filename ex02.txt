Exercise 02
Now we’re talking
Turn-in directory: ex02/
Files to turn in: Makefile, main.cpp, Fixed.{h, hpp}, Fixed.cpp
Allowed functions: roundf (from <cmath>)
Add public member functions to your class to overload the following operators:
• The 6 comparison operators: >, <, >=, <=, ==, and !=.
• The 4 arithmetic operators: +, -, *, and /.
• The 4 increment/decrement (pre-increment and post-increment, pre-decrement and
post-decrement) operators, which will increase or decrease the fixed-point value by
the smallest representable ϵ, such that 1 + ϵ > 1.
Add these four public overloaded member functions to your class:
• A static member function min that takes two references to fixed-point numbers as
parameters, and returns a reference to the smallest one.
• A static member function min that takes two references to constant fixed-point
numbers as parameters, and returns a reference to the smallest one.
• A static member function max that takes two references to fixed-point numbers as
parameters, and returns a reference to the greatest one.
• A static member function max that takes two references to constant fixed-point
numbers as parameters, and returns a reference to the greatest one.

C++ - Module 02
Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading
and the Orthodox Canonical class form
It’s up to you to test every feature of your class. However, running the code below:
#include <iostream>
int main( void ) {
Fixed a;
Fixed const b( Fixed( 5.05f ) * Fixed( 2 ) );
std::cout << a << std::endl;
std::cout << ++a << std::endl;
std::cout << a << std::endl;
std::cout << a++ << std::endl;
std::cout << a << std::endl;
std::cout << b << std::endl;
std::cout << Fixed::max( a, b ) << std::endl;
return 0;
}
Should output something like (for greater readability, the constructor/destructor messages are removed in the example below):
$> ./a.out
0
0.00390625
0.00390625
0.00390625
0.0078125
10.1016
10.1016
$>
If you ever do a division by 0, it is acceptable that the program
crashes
