Exercise 03: BSP
Exercise 03
BSP
Turn-in directory: ex03/
Files to turn in: Makefile, main.cpp, Fixed.{h, hpp}, Fixed.cpp,
Point.{h, hpp}, Point.cpp, bsp.cpp
Allowed functions: roundf (from <cmath>)
Now that you have a functional Fixed class, it would be nice to use it.
Implement a function that indicates whether a point is inside a triangle or not. Very
useful, isnâ€™t it?
BSP stands for Binary Space Partitioning. You are welcome. :)
You can pass this module without completing exercise 03.
